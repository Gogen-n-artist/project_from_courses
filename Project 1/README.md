Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, to identify patterns that determine the success of the game

### Project description:
The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world have been identified. 
Based on this, a report has been prepared for the computer game store for planning
advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current
period for analysis is selected. Portraits of users of each region have been compiled. 
Hypotheses have been tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are different. In the analysis, I used the Student's criterion for independent samples.
