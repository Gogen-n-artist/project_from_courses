I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. I
installed PostgreSQL, deployed a database. Then I wrote a pipeline script,
which allowed collecting data for a certain time period, and configured its
offline operation via crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote
a dashboard script with several filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on
the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs
