## Purpose of the study:
- Assessment of the correctness of the test
- Analysis of test results

### Task:
We have at our disposal a dataset with user actions, technical specifications and several auxiliary datasets. It is necessary to evaluate the correctness of the A/B test and analyze its results. The goal of the test is to increase conversion at each stage of the funnel.

### Project description:
The correctness of the test was analyzed, violations were found (stop date, Christmas promotion, overlap of participants in groups A and B, uneven division of groups). Adjustments have been made to the audience. Sales funnels in groups A and B were analyzed for the original and adjusted audience. Z-tests were performed to compare proportions in groups A and B.

### Skills and tools:

`Python` `Pandas` `Datetime` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Plotly` `SciPy` `NumPy`
Data processing, duplicates, cohort analysis, event funnel, visualization, A/B testing, statistical hypothesis testing using z-test for equality of proportions, data visualization.
